4. Briefly explain how you achieved the correct output

Echoing just the array will only say "Array," which brings to a different method where we use the loops to show each value instead. Looping will go through each value in the array, and to showcase that it is doing precisely that-- we echo it to show the output. Before that, we need to initialize a number so we can use that variable in our loops.

First loop outputs the exact order in the array including the duplicates, which means it does pinpoint to each value as it goes through the whole array.

Second loop outputs only the even numbers in the array, and it has the same process with an if statement within itself to identify which is even/odd. To see if it is even/odd, I used the remainder operator by 2; if it results in 0 then it is even-- if it results in 1 then it is odd. Combining the two will loop through each value and see if it fits the requirements to be part of the final output.
